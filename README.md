# Kaza-Bot
This project is a Python-based Discord Bot developed to automate common server tasks and manage user interactions for a community server. The primary engineering focus was on maximizing performance and scalability through efficient event handling.

## Core Technical Implementation:

Asynchronous Architecture: Implemented Python's native asyncio library to manage concurrent I/O operations and efficiently handle over 300+ real-time events per minute, ensuring low latency for user commands.

Event-Driven Design: Built around event-driven command handling to structure the application logic, allowing for reliable task automation and easy expansion of future commands.

Automation: Designed and deployed commands that successfully automated administrative tasks, resulting in a quantifiable 50% reduction in manual moderator time.

Version Control: Project managed using Git for collaborative development and version tracking.

## Technologies Used

Language: Python

Frameworks/Libraries: discord.py, python-dotenv, requests, feedparser

Concepts: Event-Driven Programming, Asynchronous Programming, Concurrency
